# Introduction
This package simplify controlling the transition between model states, allowing you to prevent unlogically transition and also controlling the initial state of the model using the PHP enums. Each enum allows you to define your states, the allowed transitions and the initial state, all in one place.

Laravel Enum State Machine, also allows you to automatically record the history of the state transition for each define state machine.

This package is built to help developers with the least amount of work needed to get it working.

# Installation
You can install the package via composer:
```bash
composer require tamkeen-tech/laravel-enum-state-machine
```
Next, if you going to record the history

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=enum-state-machine-migrations
```

To publish the config file, you can use the following command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=enum-state-machine-configs
```

# Usage
Imagine you have bill with statuses, so at your bill model you will need to use `HasStateMachines` trait, and define your `protected $stateMachines` array variable to include all the fields that you going to apply the state machine on, and finally an optional variable `protected $recordStateHistory` boolean to either save history or not.

```php
use TamkeenTech\LaravelEnumStateMachine\Traits\HasStateMachines;

class Bill extends Model
{
    use HasStateMachines;

    protected $fillable = [
        'status',
    ];

    protected $casts = [
        'status' => BillStatus::class,
    ];

    protected $recordStateHistory = true;

    protected $stateMachines = [
        'status'
    ];
}
```

In your `BillStatus` class you need to use trait `StateMachine` and to add two methods `transitions` to define your transition array and `initialState` to define the allowed initial states, both must return array.

```php
use TamkeenTech\LaravelEnumStateMachine\Traits\StateMachine;

enum BillStatus: string
{
    use StateMachine;

    case PENDING = 'PENDING';
    case PAID = 'PAID';
    case EXPIRED = 'EXPIRED';
    case REFUNDED = 'REFUNDED';

    public function transitions(): array
    {
        return match ($this) {
            self::PENDING => [self::PAID, self::EXPIRED],
            self::PAID => [self::REFUNDED]
        };
    }

    public function initialState(): array
    {
        return [self::PENDING];
    }
}
```

From the example above the allowed transitions for `PENDING` case are `PAID` and `EXPIRED`, and the initail state for bill must be only `PENDING`

Now you are all done, you can start writing your code safely. So now if your tried to create a bill with different state you will receive an exception.

**Example**

- create bill with different initail state
  ```php
  // throw InitailStateIsNotAllowedException with message "Only allowed initial states: PENDING"
  Bill::create([
    'status' => BillStatus::PAID
  ]);
  ```

- try to update to invalid transition
  ```php
  $bill = Bill::create([
    'status' => BillStatus::PENDING
  ]);

  // throw StateTransitionNotAllowedException with message "Only allowed transition states: PAID, EXPIRED"
  $bill->update([
    'status' => BillStatus::REFUNDED
  ]);
  ```

# State History Recording
When you enable state history recording by setting protected `$recordStateHistory = true` in your model, the package will automatically track all state changes for the fields defined in `$stateMachines`.

Each state change will be recorded in the state_machine_histories table with the following information:
- The previous state (from)
- The new state (to)
- The field name that changed
- The model type and ID
- Timestamps of the change

You can access the state history through the stateHistory relationship:

```php
$bill = Bill::find(1);
$bill->stateHistory;
```

# Flow Diagram Generation
You can generate a flow diagram of your state machine using the following command:

```bash
php artisan enum:flow-diagram "App\Enums\BillStatus"
```

You can specify a custom output directory using the --output option

```bash
php artisan enum:flow-diagram "App\Enums\BillStatus" --output=/custom/path
```

This command will create a visual representation of your state machine as a PNG file, making it easier to understand the transitions between states.

# Helper Methods
The `StateMachine` trait provides several helper methods to make working with state transitions easier.

### `canTransitTo`
This method checks if the current state can transition to a given state.

**Example**

```php
$billStatus = BillStatus::PENDING;

if ($billStatus->canTransitTo(BillStatus::PAID)) {
    // Do something
}
```

### `inInitialState`
This method checks if the current state is one of the allowed initial states.

**Example**

```php
$billStatus = BillStatus::PENDING;

if ($billStatus->inInitialState()) {
    // Do something
}
```

### `is`
This method checks if the current state is equal to a given state.

**Example**

```php
$billStatus = BillStatus::PENDING;

if ($billStatus->is(BillStatus::PENDING)) {
    // Do something
}
```
